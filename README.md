# WorkPals.co

Working remotely can lead to social isolation, loneliness, poor time management, and overwork. WorkPals, connects you with other two remote humans, creating a small remote team with a joint calendar/to-do list, where you can share your goals, and have two new friends to help you keep focused and organized.

Help others while creating **human experiences**!
